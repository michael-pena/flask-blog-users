A blog web application written in Python3 that uses Flask, SQLAlchemy, WTForms, Gravatar, CKEditor, SQLite, and Bcrypt. It lets users register for an account and comment on posts. The admin user (user id = 1) can also create, edit, and delete posts.

This blog was extended from a [BootStrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog-jekyll)

Blog data is stored in the blog.db.
